            <p>Hi, I'm Taylor! I'm currently student at Menlo School in Atherton, CA. 
                I enjoy playing electric guitar, running cross country, 
                and rewatching the Simpsons (Lisa is my spirit animal). Some 
                of my favorite books include <i>The Glass Castle</i> by Jeanette Walls,   
                <i>Hitchhiker's Guide</i> to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams, and All the  
                <i>Light We Cannot See</i> by Anthony Doerr. 
                <br><br>
                I'm also an avid Star Wars fan and a favorite pasttime of mine is programming old Atari games in Java.
                The first thing I programmed was a Flappy Bird game in JS, and some other cool
                games I've made are Dig Dug, Pac-man, and Space Invaders (maybe a waste of time but fun ðŸ˜„).

            <span>Stanford AIMI Intern <i>(Jun 2022 - Current)</i></span><br>
            I'm currently working on a project with Stanford AIMI on making education around machine
            learning more digestable and accessible to highschool students. I've been working with 
            a couple other interns on creating lesson plans on topics such as an introduction to 
            neural networks, transfer learning, and YOLO. We've been creating a website with these lessons 
            as well as exercises and applications.
            <br><br>
            Over the summer, I worked on developing a CNN which detected medical devices in chest x-rays with
            97% accuracy and used YOLO to draw bounding boxes around them.

            <span>Melcher Lab (Stanford) Employee <i>(March 2022 - Current)</i></span><br>
            There are two projects I've worked on with the Melcher lab. I wrote scripts to identify
            whether microscope images were usable (working off blurriness and tissue area in an image). I've 
            also been working on creating a GUI for a steatosis analyzer. 
            <br><br>
            Another project I've been working on is developing a suturing simulation on an Oculus. I've had a 
            lot of fun learning how to use Unity and Blender!

            I am the lead software engineer for the InZain bots, which participates in FIRST robotics 
            competitions. I'm responsible for writing programs such as our heading follower 
            (a kinematics optimization), autonomous driving, and object identification. We placed
            5th in NorCal for the 2021-2022 season.

            I am one of the founders of WINS, which is a club directed at encouraging women in STEM. One 
            of our goals is increasing female participation in advanced STEM classes by providing
            club support through resources, shared study guides for classes, and general encouragement. We
            are also beginning a mentorship program, where we pair club members with female professionals
            in their field of interest to provide opportunities for guidance and internships.

            <span>MakerDAO Summer Intern <i>(June 2022 - September 2022)</i></span><br>
            I interned for MakerDAO over the summer. I wrote scripts which automatically
            updated data on crypto KPIs and created a front-end to display them. I also 
            learned about a bit about Solidity.
